====Permissions====
This mod may be utilized for any purpose for Morrowind, as long as you credit me as the original author, except as described below. It may not be used for other games. To use or redistribute any graphic files (meshes, textures, icons) within this mod, you must contact the author of those graphics files first.

====Conflicts====
Creating new magic effects requires creating entries in a MWSE table. These entries are permanent. This mod will conflict with any mod that uses the same spell effect IDs. Other authors should check the magic effect ID list before choosing an ID to prevent conflicts.

====Installation====
1) Use a mod management tool to install this mod after the Magicka Expanded framework.
2) Use a list merging tool such as Wrye Mash to merge leveled lists.

NOTE: Creating new magic effects requires creating entries in a MWSE table. These entries are permanent.

====Removal====
1) Uninstall this mod using your mod management tool.
3) Reinstall MWSE to reset your magic effects table.

====Credits====
- RedFurryDemon for all graphic and icons.
- NullCascade, Greatness7 and Merlord for their on-going help and development of MWSE.
