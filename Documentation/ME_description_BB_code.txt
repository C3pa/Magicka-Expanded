This mod provides a framework to add new and fully functional magic effects to Morrowind. These effects behave just like vanilla effects: you can create new spells, enchant items, give them to companions, and treat them how any other effect would be treated.


This mod package uses a BAIN installer to provide the base framework, as well as multiple spell packs. Spells are broken down into spell packs so that the user can choose not to use certain sets of spells if they prefer. You can use all, some, or none of these spell packs. However, if you only install the base framework, there will be nothing new in-game. [b]Note: Dependent mods that require Magicka Expanded only require the framework pack, which has no ESP or new spells. [/b]


Each of these spell packs are outlined below. All spell packs add new spells & spell effects to the game. At this time, all spell packs do this through a new mechanism: spell tomes & grimoires. A spell tome is a book, similar to Skyrim, that will teach the player a spell. Unlike Skyrim, learning a spell requires having magicka greater than twice the magicka cost of that spell. While learning a spell, your magicka will be drained. Grimoires are spell tomes that teach two or more spells at once. They require having magicka greater than twice the sum of the magicka costs for all spells the grimoire teaches. However, spell tomes aren't destroyed in the process of learning a new spell.


This mod allows the distribution of spells through spell tomes and grimoires. Spell tomes teach 1 spell per book. Spell grimoires teach 2+ spells per book. This mod uses leveled lists and booksellers for spell distribution, but Spell Packs may use any mechanism to distribute spells. Please refer to the Spell Pack you are using for instructions for finding the spells within. [b]If using spell tomes and grimoires, they will be dynamically placed through MWSE and do not require cell edits in the Construction Set.[/b]

There is an MCM that contains buttons to help you test the framework. You can use these buttons to add all loaded spells to the player, as well as tomes and grimoires. You can also set your stats instantly. Please note there may be a slight delay when adding spells / items through the MCM, if you are using a lot of ME dependent mods.


At this time, there are 103 new spell effects available in the following spell packs:

[b]1) Resource Pack
[/b]
This pack is required if using any of the spell packs below. If not using any of the spell packs below, do not install. It provides shared resources and a single ESP for all spell packs to use.

[b]2) Lore Friendly Pack[/b]

[b]4) Teleportation Pack[/b]

The Teleportation Pack adds balanced teleportation effects to Morrowind's most popular cities.

[b]Graphic assets[/b]

The meshes, textures, and book illustrations are modders' resources free to use in your mods, provided that you include a link to RFD's Nexus profile in your mod's credits. The meshes can only be used for Morrowind modding, as they are based on original MW assets; textures and illustrations were created from scratch.

You may not include this mod in a compilation without RFD's permission.

On a side note, you may not use any of RFD's assets in mods that have anything to do with Archimag/Axemagister, as RFD does not wish to be of any help to someone who happened to disregard three of his asset usage permissions.
