Magicka Expanded - Weather Magic Pack

By: OperatorJack & RedFurryDemon

====Requirements====

- Morrowind
- Tribunal
- Bloodmoon
- MGE XE 0.10.1
- MWSE 2.1+
- Magicka Expanded Framework

This mod requires the most recently nightly build of MWSE. Please be sure to run the mwse-update.exe before playing this mod.

====Description====
This mod adds these new weather magic effects:

- Weather: Blizzard
- Weather: Snow
- Weather: Thunderstorm
- Weather: Ashstorm
- Weather: Blightstorm
- Weather: Clear
- Weather: Cloudy
- Weather: Foggy
- Weather: Overcast
- Weather: Rain

These effects will transform the weather. These effects will only work outdoors, and they cannot transform the Blight into another weather type.


All of these spells can be learned through spell tomes. These spell tomes are only available through leveled lists in the wild, or by taking them from powerful NPCs as described in the "Book Locations" file.

This mod IS NOT compatible with OpenMW, at least until support for MWSE mods is added.


====Permissions====
Scripting/writing
This mod may be utilised for any purpose for Morrowind, as long as you credit OJ as the original author, except as described below. It may not be used for other games.

Graphic assets
The meshes, textures, and book illustrations are modders' resources free to use in your mods, provided that you include a link to RFD's Nexus profile in your mod's credits. The meshes can only be used for Morrowind modding, as they are based on original MW assets; textures and illustrations were created from scratch.
Please do not edit the .dds files (because of compression). Contact RFD for the source files instead.

You may not include this mod in a compilation without RFD's permission.

====Conflicts====
Creating new magic effects requires creating entries in a MWSE table. These entries are permanent. This mod will conflict with any mod that uses the same spell effect IDs. Other authors should check the magic effect ID list before choosing an ID to prevent conflicts.

====Installation & Removal====
Installation:
1) Use a mod management tool to install this mod using the provided BAIN installer. Or just install it manually, if that's your thing.
2) Enable the .esp files for the framework and spell packs.
2) Use a list merging tool such as Wrye Mash to merge levelled lists.

NOTE: Creating new magic effects requires creating entries in a MWSE table. These entries are permanent. 

Removal:
1) Uninstall this framework and any Spell Packs using your mod management tool.
2) Reinstall MWSE to reset your magic effects table. This is only needed if you are using another mod that claims the same spell effect IDs as this one.
